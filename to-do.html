      <h2>React To-Do Tracker: A Study in State Management and Persistence</h2>
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a modern and responsive To-Do List application built
        entirely with React. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for
        users to add, manage, filter, and delete their daily tasks, helping to
        boost productivity. A key feature is its use of the browser's local
        storage to ensure that tasks persist even after the user closes the tab,
        providing a seamless and reliable user experience.
      </p>

      <h3>Project Description:</h3>
      <p>
        The To-Do Tracker was developed as a hands-on project to master core
        React concepts, particularly component-based architecture, state
        management with hooks, and handling user events. The application is
        structured logically with reusable components for the input form,
        individual task items, and the main task list.
      </p>
      <p>The application was built using the following core technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>React.js:</span> The entire user interface is built as a Single
          Page Application (SPA). The project heavily utilizes React Hooks like
          <code>useState</code> for managing the list of tasks and
          <code>useEffect</code> for handling side effects like saving data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Browser Local Storage API:</span> Implemented to provide data
          persistence. The <code>useEffect</code> hook synchronizes the
          application's state with the browser's local storage, ensuring the
          user's to-do list is automatically saved and reloaded on return
          visits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>CSS3 & Responsive Design:</span> Custom CSS with Flexbox is used
          to create a clean, minimalist design that is fully responsive,
          providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile
          devices.
        </li>
      </ul>
