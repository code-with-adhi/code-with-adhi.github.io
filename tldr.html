      <h2>TLDR News: An AI-Powered Full-Stack News Summarizer</h2>
      <h3>Overview:</h3>
      <p>
        TLDR News is a full-stack web application designed to combat information
        overload. It fetches top headlines from around the world, allows the
        user to select an article, and then uses a custom-built web scraper and
        the Google Gemini AI to provide a concise, easy-to-read summary. This
        project demonstrates a complete development cycle, from frontend
        interface design to a complex, containerized backend service.
      </p>

      <h3>Project Description:</h3>
      <p>
        This application solves a common problem: not having enough time to read
        full news articles. It features a React-based frontend that communicates
        with a powerful Node.js backend. The backend is responsible for fetching
        news, performing robust web scraping, and interfacing with the AI model
        for summarization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was built with a focus on scalability and modern development
        practices, utilizing the following technologies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>React.js & React Router:</span> The client-side is a dynamic
          Single Page Application (SPA) that provides a seamless user experience
          for browsing headlines and viewing summarized articles without page
          reloads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Node.js & Express.js:</span> The backend server handles all API
          requests, managing the logic for fetching news, scraping external
          sites, and processing summarization requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Puppeteer & Readability.js:</span> A sophisticated web scraping
          service was built to navigate to external news articles, bypass
          anti-scraping measures, and intelligently extract the core article
          content, stripping away ads and boilerplate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Google Gemini API:</span> Integrated to provide high-quality,
          context-aware summaries of the scraped article text, turning long-form
          content into a quick digest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Docker & Render:</span> The entire backend is containerized
          using Docker, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment. It is
          deployed as a web service on Render, showcasing modern DevOps and
          cloud deployment skills.
        </li>
      </ul>
